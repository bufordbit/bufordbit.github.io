### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was one of my favorite labs because it was the first time that I had interacted with code and saw how the process went. I learned how to write code that would output text and how to work with a repository by editing it and pushing it.

* Lab 3 Part 1

    Lab 3, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because I learned how to write an equation with variables that I would get from code outputting prompts that would ask for the diameter and price of the pizza. Then it would calculate the unit price of the pizza using the equation. 

* Lab 7 Part 1

    Lab 7, part 1 was one of the most difficult labs for me, but it was still one of my favorites because I learned how to use if-else statements to create a loop that allowed me to create a game of Hi-Lo that gave the player multiple turns.
